

 Okay, hold on. Don't shoot. You see where you're going?

 Mhm.

 Okay, now let's worry about how you get there. 

 Here. Can you see?

 Yeah.

 You sure?

 Mhm. 

 How about now?



 Alright. Ready your fingers.

 Nice.

 Nice throw, kiddo.

 You go.

 Hey, you guys want mayo or mustard, or both? 

 Who wants mayo on a hotdog?

 Probably your brothers.



 Uh, two mustard, please! Thanks, mama. 

 Mayo or mustard?

 How about ketchup?

 Ketchup? 

 Mind your elbow.  Hahaha! Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your arrow.

 Hey guys! Enough practice, soup's on!

 Alright, we're coming; we're hungry.  Lila, let's go.  Lila?  Honey?  Hey, babe! Babe? Babe? Boys? Boys? Laura?









 Wrra! 

 You don't need to do that. Because uh... you're just holding position.  Oh yeah, that was close.  That's a goal. We're now one apiece.

 I would like to try again. 

 We tied up. Feel the tension? It's fun.



 That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win. 

 And... you've won. Congratulations. 

 Fair game. Good sport.  Have fun?

 It was fun.



 This thing on?  Hey, Miss Potts... Pep. If you find this recording, don't post it on social media. It's gonna be a real tear-jerker. I don't know if you're ever going to see these. I don't even know if you're... if you're still... Oh god, I hope so. Today is day 21, uh 22.  You know, if it wasn't for the existential terror of staring into a void of space, I'd say I'm feeling better today. The infection's run its course, Thanks to the blue meanie back there.  You'd love her. Very practical. Only a tiny bit sadistic. Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge to buy ourselves about 48 hours of time.  But it's now dead in the water. We're 1000 light years from the nearest 7-11. Oxygen will run out tomorrow. And that'll be it. And Pep, I ... I know I said no more surprises, but I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like... well you know what it looks like. Don't feel bad about this. I mean, if you grovel for a couple of weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt. I should probably lie down. Please know that... when I drift off, I will think about you. Because it's always you.







 Couldn't stop him.

 Neither could I.

 I lost the kid.

 Tony, we lost.

 Is, uh...? 

 Oh, my God! Oh, my God! 

 It's okay.



 It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth.

 World governments are in pieces. The parts that are still working are trying to take a census. And it looks like he did... he did exactly what he said he was gonna do. Thanos wiped out fifty percent, of all living creatures.

 Where is he now? Where?

 We don't know. He just opened a portal and walked through.



 What's wrong with him?

 Oh, he's pissed. He thinks he failed. Which of course he did, but you know there's a lot of that's going around, ain't there?

 Honestly, until this exact second, I thought you were a Build-A-Bear.

 Maybe I am.

 We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now. Deep Space scans, and satellites, and we got nothing. Tony, you fought him.

 Who told you that?  I didn't fight him. No, he wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the store. That's what happened. There was no fight.

 Okay.

 He's unbeatable.

 Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?

 Pfft! I saw this coming a few years back. I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it. Thought I was dreaming.

 Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.

  And I needed you. As in past tense. That trumps what you need. It's too late buddy. Sorry. You know what I need?  I need to shave. And I believe I remember telling all youse -



 Tony, Tony, Tony!

 Alive and otherwise what we needed was a suit of armor around the world! Remember that? Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not- that's what we needed!

 Well, that didn't work out, did it?

 I said, "we'd lose". You said, "We'll do that together too." And guess what, Cap? We lost. And you weren't there. But that's what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We're the Avengers, we're the Avengers. Not the Prevengers.

 Okay.

 Right?

 You made your point. Just sit down.

 Okay...

 Okay?

 Nah, nah. Here's my point. You know what?

 Tony, you're sick.

  She's great, by the way.

 Sit down. Sit.

 We need you. You're new blood. Bunch of tired old mules!  I got nothing for you, Cap! I got no coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero. Zip. Nada. No trust. Liar.



 Here, take this. You find him, and you put that on. You hide.



 Tony!

 I'm fine. I...





 Bruce gave him a sedative. He's gonna probably be out for the rest of the day.

 You guys take care of him. And I'll bring him a Xorrian Elixir when I come back.



 Where are you going?

 To kill Thanos.



 Hey, you know, we usually work as a team here, and between you and I, morale's a little fragile.

 We realize up there is more your territory, but this is our fight too.

 You even know where he is?

 I know people who might.

 "To the Garden."

 That's cute, Thanos has a retirement plan.

 So where is he?

 When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. No one's ever seen anything like it... Until two days ago.  On this planet.

 Thanos is there.

 He used the stones again.

 Hey, hey, hey. We'd be going in short-handed, you know.

 Look, he's still got the stones, so...

 So let's get him... Use them to bring everyone back.

 Just like that?

 Yeah, just like that.



 Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this... I mean we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try.

 If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end any differently than it did before?

 Because before, you didn't have me.

 Hey, new girl, everyone here is about that superhero life. And if you don't mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time?

 There are a lot of other planets in the universe. And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys.



 I like this one. 

 Let's go get this son of a bitch.





 Okay, who here hasn't been to space?



 Why?

 You better not throw up on my ship.

 Approaching jump in 3... 2... 1!



 I'll head down for recon.



 This is gonna work, Steve.

 I know it will.



 Cause I don't know what I'm going to do if it doesn't.



 No satellites, no ships, no armies, no ground defenses of any kind. It's just him.

 And that's enough.







 Oh no.

 Where are they?

 Answer the question!

 The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose, beyond temptation.

 You murdered trillions! 

 You should be grateful. 

 Where are the Stones?

 Gone. Reduced to atoms.

 You used them two days ago!

 I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be.  I am... inevitable.

 We have to tear this place apart, he-he-he has to be lying.

 My father is many things. A liar is not one of them.

 Ah, thank you, daughter.  Perhaps I treated you too harshly.



 What... What did you do?



 I went for the head.



FIVE



YEARS



LATER





 So I, uh... Went on a date the other day. It's the first time in five years, you know? I'm sitting there at dinner... I didn't even know what to talk about.

 What did you talk about?

 Same old crap, you know? How things have changed, and... my job, his job... How much we miss the Mets. And then things get quiet... He cried as they were serving the salads.

 What about you?

 I cried... just before dessert. But I'm seeing him again tomorrow, so...

 That's great. You did the hardest part. You took the jump, you didn't know where you were gonna come down. And that's it. That's those little brave baby steps we gotta take. To try and become whole again, try and find purpose. I went in the ice in '45 right after I met the love of my life. Woke up 70 years later. You gotta move on. Gotta to move on. The world is in our hands. It's left to us guys, and we got to do something with it. Otherwise... Thanos should have killed all of us.





  What the hell?



 Hope?





  Kid! Hey kid!



 What the hell happened here?



 No. Please. Please, please.  No, no, no. No.  Excuse me, sorry. No, Cassie, no.



  Please, please, please, please... No, Cassie. 

 What?





 Cassie?

 Dad? 

 You're so big!





 Yeah, we boarded that highly suspect warship Danvers pinged.



 It was an infectious garbage scowl.

 So, thanks for the hot tip. 

 Well, you were closer.

 Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.

  You get a reading on those tremors?

 It was a mild subduction under the African plate.

 Do we have a visual? How are we handling it?

 Nat, it's an earthquake under the ocean. We handle it by not handling it.

  Carol, are we seeing you here next month?

 Not likely.

 What, you gonna get another haircut?

  Listen fur-face, I'm covering a lot of territory. The things that are happening on Earth, are happening everywhere, on thousands of planets.

  All right, all right, that's a good point. That's a good point.

 So you might not see me for a long time.

 Alright. Uh, well. This channel is always active. So, if anything goes sideways... anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't... comes through me.



 Okay.

 Alright.



  Good luck. 



 Where are you?

 Mexico. The Federales found a room full of bodies. Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never even had the chance to get their guns off.

 It's probably a rival gang.

 Except it isn't.  It's definitely Barton. What he's done here, what he's been doing for the last few years... I mean, the scene that he left...  I gotta tell you, there's a part of me that doesn't even want to find him.



 Will you find out where he's going next?

 Nat...

 Please.

  Okay. 



 You know I'd offer to cook you dinner but you seem pretty miserable already. 

 You here to do your laundry?

 And to see a friend.

 Clearly, your friend is fine.

 You know I saw a pod of whales when I was coming up the bridge.

 In the Hudson?

 There's fewer ships, cleaner water.

 You know, if you're about to tell me to look on the bright side. Um... I'm about you to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich. 

 Sorry. Force of habit. 

 You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on and... grow. Some do. But not us.

 If I move on, who does this?

 Maybe it doesn't need to be done.

  I used to have nothing. And then I got this. This job... this family. And I was... I was better because of it. And even though... they're gone... I'm still trying to be better.

 I think we both need to get a life.

  You first.



 Oh! Hi. Hi! Is anyone home? This is Scott Lang. We met a few years ago, at the airport? In Germany? I got really big, and I had my mask on. You wouldn't recognize me.

  Is this an old message?

  It's the front gate.

 Ant-Man? Ant-Man, I know you know that. I need to talk to you guys.



 Scott. Are you okay?

 Yeah. I'm fine.



 Have you ever studied Quantum Physics?

 Only to make conversation.

 Alright. So... five years ago, right before Thanos, I was in a place called the Quantum Realm. The Quantum Realm is like its own microscopic universe. To get in there, you have to be incredibly small. Hope, she's my... She was my...  She was supposed to pull me out. And then Thanos happened, and I got stuck in there.

 I'm sorry. That must've been a very long five years.

 Yeah, but that's just it. It wasn't. For me, it was five hours.



 See, the rules of the Quantum Realm aren't like they are up here. Everything is unpredictable. Is that anybody's sandwich? I'm starving.



 Scott, what are you talking about?

 What I'm saying is, time works differently in the Quantum Realm. The only problem is right now, we don't have a way to navigate it. But what if we did? I can't stop thinking about it. What if, we could somehow control the chaos, and we could navigate it? What if there was a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time but then exit at another point in time? Like... Like before Thanos.

 Wait, are you talking about a time machine?

 No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine. It's more like a... Yeah, a time machine. I know it's crazy. But I can't stop thinking about it. There's gotta be some way... There's gotta be...some w... it's crazy.

 Scott, I get e-mails from a raccoon, so nothing sounds crazy anymore.

 So who do we talk to about this?



  Chow time!  Morgoona? Morgan H. Stark. You want some lunch?

 Define lunch or be disintegrated. 



 Okay, You should not be wearing that, okay? That is part of a special anniversary gift I'm making for Mom. 

 Okay.

 There you go. Are you thinking about lunch? I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.

 No.

 That's what you want. How did you find this?

 Garage.

 Really? Were you looking for it?

 No. I found it, though.

 You like going to the garage, huh? So does daddy. It's fine, actually. Your mom never wears anything I buy her.



  Now, we know what it sounds like...

 Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible?

 Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition. Can we agree on that?



  Thank you.

 In Layman's terms, it means you're not coming home.

 I did.

 No, you accidentally survived. It's a billion to one cosmic fluke. And now you wanna pull off a... What do you call it?

  A time heist?

 Yeah, a time heist. Of course, why didn't we think of this before? Oh, because it's laughable? Because it's a pipedream?

 The Stones are in the past. We can go back and get them.

 We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everyone back.

 Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?

 I don't believe we would.

 Gotta say, sometimes I miss that giddy optimism. However, high hopes won't help if there's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist. I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise.

 Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. That means no talking to our past selves, no betting on sporting events -

 I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott. Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on Back To The Future?

  No.

 Good. You had me worried there. 'Cause that'd be horse shit. That's not how quantum physics works.

 Tony... We have to take a stand.

 We did stand. And yet, here we are.

 I know you got a lot on the line. You got a wife, a daughter. But I lost someone very important to me. A lot of people did.  And now, now we have a chance to bring her back. To bring everyone back. And you're telling me that won't even...

 That's right, Scott, I won't even. I got a kid.



 Mommy told me to come and save you.

 Good job. I'm saved.  I wish you'd come here to ask me something else. Anything else. Honestly, I... I missed you guys, it was... Oh, and table's set for six.

 Tony, I get it. And I'm happy for you, I really am. But this is a second chance.

 I got my second chance right here, Cap. I can't roll the dice again. If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch.



 He's scared.

 He's not wrong.

 Yeah, but I mean, what are we gonna do? We need him. What, are we gonna stop?

 No, I wanna do it right. We're gonna need a really big brain.

  Bigger than his?



 Come on, I feel like I'm the only one eating.  Try some of that. Have some eggs.

 I'm so confused.

  These are confusing times.

 Right. No, no, that's not what I meant.

  No, I get it. I'm kidding! I know. It's crazy. I'm wearing shirts now.

 Yeah! Wh...How? Why?

 Five years ago, we got our asses beaten. Except it was worse for me. Because I lost twice. First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost. Then, we all lost.

 No one blamed you, Bruce.

 I did. For years, I've been treating the Hulk like he's some kind of disease, something to get rid of. But then I started looking at him as the cure. Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Best of both worlds...



 Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?

 Yes?

 Can we get a photo?

 100%, little person. Come on, step up.  You mind?

 Oh, yeah.

 Thanks,  Say "green"! 

 Did you get that?

  Don't you wanna grab one with me? I'm Ant-Man.

 They're Hulk fans, they don't know Ant-Man. Nobody does.

 Wait, no, no, he feels bad. No, he wants you to...he wants to... You want to take a picture with him, right? 

 He's even saying no he doesn't. I get it. I don't want it either.

 But, come on, the kid! But he...but you...

 I don't want a picture with them.

  He's gonna feel bad.  Sorry. They said they'd do it.

 I don't want it anymore.

 No, no...you feel bad.

 Just take the goddamn phone.



 Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

 No, it's great kids. Thank you very much. Hulk out!

 Bruce.

  Dab!

 Bruce.

 Listen to your Mom. She knows better.

 About we were saying...

 Right. The whole time travel do-over? Guys, it's outside my area of expertise.

 Well, you pulled this off. I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible time, too.





 Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what check out. So, recommend one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a mobius strip, inverted, please.

 Processing...

 Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle factoring, and a spectral decomp. That will take a second.

 Just a moment.

 And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda -

 Model rendered.



 Shit!

 Shit.



  What are you doing up, little mess?

 Shit.

 No, we don't say that. Only Mommy says that word. She coined it, it belongs to her.

 Why you up?

 'Cause I got some important shit going on here.  What do you think? No, I got something on my mind. I got something on my mind.

 Was it Juice Pops?

 Sure was. That's extortion. Great minds think alike. Juice Pops, exactly was on... my mind.



 You done? Yeah, now you are.  That face goes there.

 Tell me a story.

 A story... Once upon a time, Morgoona went to bed. The end.

  That's a horrible story.

 Come on, that's your favorite story. I love you tons. 

 I love you 3000.

  Wow.  3000. That's crazy.  Go to bed. Or I'll sell all your toys. Night, night.



 Not that it's a competition, but she loves me 3000. You were somewhere on the low 6 to 900 range. 

  What are you reading?

 Oh, it's just a book on composting.

  What's new with composting?

 Just -

 I figured it out, by the way.

 You know, just so we're talking about the same thing -

 Time travel.

  What? Wow... That's amazing, and... terrifying.

 That's right.

 We got really lucky.

 Yeah, I know.

 A lot of people didn't.

 No, I can't help everybody.

 It sort a seems like you can.

 Not if I stop. I can put a pin in it right now, and stop.

 Tony, trying to get you to stop has been one of the few failures of my life.



 I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of a lake... go to bed.

 But would you be able to rest?



 Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one. Scott, fire up the uhhh... the van thing.



 Breakers are set, emergency generators are on standby.

 Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't wanna lose Tiny here in the 1950's. 

 Excuse me?

 He's kidding.  You can't say things like that!

 Just... It was a bad joke.

 You were kidding, right?

  I have no idea. We're talking about time travel here. Either it's all a joke, or none of it is.  We're good! Get your helmet on, Scott. I'm gonna send you back a week, let you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds. Makes sense?

 Perfectly not confusing

 Good luck, Scott. You got this.

 You're right. I do, Captain America.



 On the count of three. 3... 2... 1!



 Uh, guys? This...this doesn't feel right.

 What is this?

 What's going on?

 That...who is that?



 Hold on. 

 Is that Scott?

 Yes, it's Scott!



 Ow! My back!

 What is this?

 Can I get a little space here.

 Yeah yeah. Can you bring him back?

 I'm working on it! 



 It's a baby. 

 It's Scott.

 As a baby!

 He'll grow.

 Bring Scott back!

  When I say kill the power, kill the power.

 Oh my god. 

 And... Kill it!



 Somebody peed my pants.

 Oh thank god.

 But I don't know if it was "baby" me or "old" me...Or just "me" me.

  Time travel!



 What? I..I see this as an absolute win!



 He turned into a baby.

 Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?



  That's the EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might've wound up pushing time through Lang. It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody shoulda cautioned you against it.

 You did.

 Oh, did I?  Thank God I'm here. Regardless, I fixed it.  A fully functioning Time-Space GPS. I just want peace.  Turns out, resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.

 Me too.

 Bring back what we lost? I hope, yes. Keep what I got? I have to, at all costs. And... maybe not die trying will be nice.

 Sounds like a deal. 



 Tony...

 Why? He made it for you.  Plus, honestly I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding.



 Thank you, Tony.

 Will you keep that a little quiet? Didn't bring one for the whole team.  ...We are getting the whole team, yeah?

 We're working on that right now.



 Hey, homie! Where's Big Green?

 Uh, Kitchen, I think.  That's awesome.

  Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There's an idiot on the landing zone.



 Oh, God!

 What's up, regular sized man?





 Kind of a step down from a from a golden palace for an Avenger highness and whatnot.

 Hey, have a little compassion, pal. First they've lost Asgard, then half the people. They're probably just happy to have a home. 

 You shouldn't have come!

 Ah, Valkyrie! Great to see you, Angry Girl.

  I think I liked you better either of the other ways.

  This is Rocket.

 How you doin'?

  He won't see you.

 That bad, huh?

 We only see him once a month, when he comes for...  ... supplies.

 It's that bad.

 Yeah.



  What the...  Woo! Something died in here.

 Hello? Thor?

  Are you here about the cable?



 The Cinemax ran out about two weeks ago, and the sports were all kind of fuzzy. 

 Thor?

 BOYS! Oh my God! Its so to see you!  Come here, you little rascal!

 No, I'm good. I'm good. That's not necessary.

 Hulk, you know my friends, Miek, Korg, right?



 Hey boys!

 Hey guys, long time no see.

 Beer's on the bucket. Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi. No password, obviously.  Thor, he's back. The kid on the TV that called me a dickhead again.

 Noobmaster?

 Yeah, Noobmaster69 called me a dickhead.



 Noobmaster? Yeah, it's Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder? Listen, buddy. If you don't log off this game immediately, I'm gonna fly over to your house, come down to that basement you're hiding in, rip off your arms then shove them up your butt! Oh, that's right. Yes, now go cry to your father, you little weasel!

  Thank you, Thor.

 Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?

 Thank you very much. I will.

 So you guys want a drink? What are you drinking? We have beer, tequila, all sorts of things.



 Buddy, you all right?

 ​​​​​​Yes, I'm fine! Why, don't I look all right?

  You look like melted ice cream.

  So, what's up?

 We need your help. There might be a chance we could fix everything.

 What, like the cable?  Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks.

 Like Thanos.



 Don't you say that name.



 Um, yeah. We don't actually say that name in here.

  Please take your hand off me.  Now, I know that... guy might scare you.

 Why would I be? Why would, why would I be scared of that guy? I'm the one who killed that guy, remember? Anyone else here killed that guy? Nope. Didn't think so. Korg, why don't you, tell everybody who chopped Thanos' big head off.



 Umm... Stormbreaker?

 Now, who's swingin' Stormbreaker?

 I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay? I've been there myself. You wanna know who helped me out of it?

 I don't know. Is it... Natasha?

 It was you. You helped me.

  Why don't you ask the, Asgardians down there, how much my help was worth.  The ones that are left, anyway.

 I think we can bring them back.

 Stop. stop, okay?  I know you think I'm down here wallowing in my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and and saved. But I'm fine, okay? We're fine, aren't we?



 Nah, all good here, mate.



 So, whatever it is that you're offering, we're not into it, don't care, couldn't care less. Goodbye.

  We need you, pal.



  There's beer on the ship.

  What kind?





 あいつだ! アキヒコさんを！ 



 てめえ なぜこんなことをする? 俺たちてめえになにもしてねぇだろ！ 

 地球の半分 サノスにやられた... お前はなぜ無事なの… 



  お前はもう十分殺しただろ You're done hurting people.

 俺らがだと? 気でも狂ったか!   





  死ね!  



 待て! 助けてくれ! お前に何でもやる! 何が欲しい? 

  What I want... You can't give me.



 You shouldn't be here.

 Neither should you.

 I've got a job to do.

 Is that what you're calling this? Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back.



 We found something. A chance, maybe...

  Don't...

 Don't what?

 ...don't give me hope.

 I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.



  Drifting left. On the side there, Lebowski.  Ratchet, How's it going?

 It's Rocket. Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal.



 Time travel suit? Not bad.

  Hey, hey, hey! Easy, easy!

 I'm being very careful.

 No, you're being very Hulky.

 I'm being careful.

  These are Pym Particles, alright? And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it. This is what we have. We're not making any more.

 Scott, calm down.

 Sorry. We've got enough for one round trip each. That's it. No do-overs. Plus two test runs.  One test run.



 All right. I'm not ready for this.

 I'm game. I'll do it.



 Clint, now you're gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift. Don't worry about it.



 Wai-Wait a second, let me ask you something. If we can do this, you know, go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos, you know, and... 

  First of all, that's horrible...

  It's Thanos.

 ...And secondly, time doesn't work that way. Changing the past doesn't change the future.

 Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them... Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved.

 Bingo.

 That's not how it works.

 Well, that's what I heard.

 What? By who? Who told you that?

  Star Trek, Terminator, TimeCop, Time After Time -

 Quantum Leap -

 A Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time -

 Hot Tub Time Machine -

 Hot Tub Time Machine. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically, any movie that deals with time travel.

 Die Hard? No, it's not one...

 This is known.

 If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future. And your former present becomes the past. Which can't now be changed by your new future...

 Exactly.

 So... Back To The Future's a bunch of bullshit?

  Alright, Clint. We're going in 3... 2... 1!





 Cooper? Where are my headphones?

  Lila?  Lila! 



 Dad?  Dad?





 Hey, hey. Look at me. You okay?

  Yeah, it worked. It worked.



 Okay, so the "how" works. Now we gotta figure out the when and the where. Almost all of us has had an encounter with at least one of the six Infinity Stones.

 Well I'd substitute the word encounter for damn well near been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones.

 I haven't, I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about

 Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particles for one round trip each, and these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.

 Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in.

 Which means we have to pick our targets.

 Correct.

 Let's start with the Aether. Thor, what do you know?



 Is he asleep?

 No, I'm pretty sure he's dead.



 Where to start? Umm... The Aether, first, is not a stone, someone called it a stone before. It's more of a... an angry sludge thing, so... someones gonna need to amend that. Here's an interesting story though, many years ago... My grandfather had to hide the stones from the Dark Elves...  Wooooh, scary beings. So Jane,  Oh, there she is. That's Jane... She's... an old flame of mine... She... she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time... and then the Aether stuck itself inside her... And, she became very, very sick. So I had to take her to Asgard, which is where I'm from. And we had to try and fix her. We were dating at the time, you see. I got to introduce her to my Mother... who's dead,  and oh you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, these things happen though you know, nothing last forever,  I'm not done yet, the only thing permanent in life is impermanence.

 Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?

 I'd like a Bloody Mary, thank you.



 Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.

 Is that a person?

 Morag's a planet. Quill was a person.

 A planet? Like in outer space?

 Oh, look. It's like a little puppy, all happy and everything.  Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy? I'll get you to space.



 Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.

  What is Vormir?

 A dominion of death, at the very center of Celestial existence. It's where... Thanos murdered my sister.



 Not it.



 That Time Stone guy...

 Doctor Strange.

 Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?

 Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit from a hat.

 Nice place in the village, though.

 Yeah. Sullivan Street.

 Hmm... Bleecker.

 Wait, he lived in New York?

 No. He lived in Toronto.

 Guys, if you pick the right year, there are three stones in New York.

  Shut the front door.



 All right. We have a plan. Six Stones, three teams. One shot.





 Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends... We lost family... We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know. But it doesn't mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we're gonna win.  Whatever it takes. Good luck.

 He's pretty good at that.

 Right? 

 All right. You heard the man. Stroke those keys, jolly green.

 Tractors engaged.

  You promise to bring that back in one piece, right?

 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I'll do my best.

 As promises go, that was pretty lame.

  See you in a minute.





 All right, we all have our assignments. Two Stones uptown, one Stone, down. Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock.



 Feel free to smash a few things along the way.

 I think it's gratuitous, but whatever.





 I'd be careful going that way. We just had the floors waxed.

 Ma'am, I'm looking for Doctor Strange.

 You're about... five years too early. Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery about twenty blocks that way. What do you want from him?

 That, actually.



 Ah! I'm afraid not.

 Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

 You don't wanna do this.

 Ah, you're right, I don't.  But I need that stone, and I don't have time to beat it-



 Let's start over, shall we?



 That's Jane.

 You're gonna charm her and I'm gonna poke her with this thing,  and extract the Reality Stone and get gone, lickety-split.

 I'll be right back, okay? There's a wine cellar, that's just down there. My father used to fish huge barrel of ale. I'll see if the cellar has a couple of...

 Hey! Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already?



 Who's the fancy broad?

 It's my Mother. She dies today.

 Oh. That's today?

 I can't do this. I can't do this. I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.This was a bad idea.

 Come here. 

 No, no, no. I think I'm having...I'm having a panic attack. I shouldn't be here...this is...this is a bad-

 Come here. Right here.



 You think you're the only one who lost people? What do you think we're doing here? I lost the only family I ever had. Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna, all gone. Now, I get you miss your Mom. But she's gone. Really gone. And there are plenty of people who are only kinda gone. But you can help them. So is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs outta your beard, make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants, and when she's not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone and help me get my family back?

 Okay.

 Are you crying?

 No...Yes!

 Get it together! You can do this. You can do this. All right?

 Yes, I can.

 Good.

 I can do this. I can do it, I can't do this.



 Alright, Heartbreaker. She's alone. This is our shot.  Thor? Thor!



 Alright. Bring it down low. Right on that line. That's it. Down, down.

 Hey, can we hurry it up?

 Guys, chop-chop. Come on. We're on a clock.

[Nebula walks out of the ship, apparently having directed it to its next destination.

 All that, is really helpful.  Take care, okay?

 Yeah.

 Take that stone and come back. No messing around.

  Hey. You got this.

 Let's get it done. Yes, sir.

  See you back.

 You guys watch each other's six.



 Yeah.



 The coordinates for Vormir are laid in. All they have to do is not fall out.



 We're a long way from Budapest.





 Okay, so, uhh... We just wait around for this Quill guy to show up and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?

  Let's take cover. We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.

 Wait a minute, what are you talking about right now? Who else is looking for these stones?

 My father, my sister... and me.

 And you? Where are you right now?



  You're welcome.

 I didn't ask for your help.

 And yet, you always need it. Get up. Father wants us back on the ship.

 Why?

 He's found an Infinity Stone.

 Where?

 On a planet called Morag.

 Father's plan is finally in motion.

 One stone isn't six, Nebula.

 It’s a start.

 If he gets all of them...



 Ronan's located the Power Stone. I'm dispatching you to his ship.

 He won't like that.

 His alternative is death, then.  Ronan's obsession clouds his judgement.

 We will not fail you, Father.



 No, you won't.

 I swear...I will make you proud.



 We just, wait around for this Quill guy to show up, and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?

 Let's take cover. We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.



 Who was that?

 I don't know...My head is splitting...I don't know...

 Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle.



 Ssshhh...  Bring her to my ship.



 Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like they're just about wrapped up here.



 Got it. I'm approaching the elevator now.

 If it's all the same to you... I'll have that drink now.

 All right. Good one. No standing around, I'm closing up this door for later.  By the way, feel free to clean up.

 Uh, Mr. Rogers. I almost forgot that that suit  did nothing for your ass.

 No one asked you to look, Tony.

  It's ridiculous

 I think you look great, Cap. As far as I'm concerned, that's America's ass. 

 Uhh, magic wand?

 STRIKE team's coming to secure it.



 We can take that  off your hands.

 By all means. Careful with that thing.

 Unless you want your mind erased. And not in a fun way.

 We promise to be careful.

 Who are these guys?

 They are SHIELD...Well, actually Hydra. But, we didn't know that yet.

 Seriously, you didn't? I mean...they look like bad guys.

 You're small, but you're talking loud.

 On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.

  On my way down to coordinate search and rescue!  I mean, honestly! How do you think you'll be...

  Shut up.

 All right, you're up, little buddy.  There's our stone.

  Alright. Flick me.





 Whoa!

 Whoa, whoa. Hey! Buddy. What do you think? Maximum occupancy has been reached.

 Take the stairs.

 Yeah.  Stop. Stop!



  Take the stairs! Take the stairs!

 All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the elevator just passing the 80th floor.

 On it. Head to the lobby.

 Alright. I'll see you there.



 Evidence secure. We're en route to Dr. List. No. No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary.



 Captain. I thought you were coordinating search and rescue?

 Change of plans.

 Hey, Cap.

 Rumlow.  I just got a call from the Secretary. I'm gonna be running point on the scepter.

 Sir? I don't understand.

 We got word there may be an attempt to steal it.

 Sorry, Cap. I can't give you the scepter.

 I'm gonna have to call the Director.

 That's okay. Trust me.  Hail Hydra.





  So many stairs!



 Thumbelina, do you copy? I've got eyes on the prize. It's go-time.

 Bombs away.  Is... is that Axe body spray?

 Yeah, I had a can just for emergencies. Relax. Can we focus, please?

 I'm going inside you. Now.

 May I ask you where you're going?

 To lunch and then Asgard. I'm sorry, you are?

 Alexander Pierce. He's the man, one of the folks behind Nick Fury.

 My friends call me Mr. Secretary. I'm gonna have to ask you to turn that prisoner over to me.

 Loki will be answering to Odin himself.

 Oh, he's gonna answer to us. Odin can have what's left. And I'm gonna need that case, that's been SHIELD property for over 70 years.

 Hand over the case, Stark.

  All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey up here. Let's go.

 I'm not gonna argue who's got the higher authority here, all right?

 You promise me you won't die?

 You're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

 That doesn't sound mild.

 I need the case.

 I know you got a lotta pull. I'm just saying...

 Okay. Then give me the case.

 Do it, Lang!

 Get your hands off!

 Window's closing. Pull my pin!

 Here goes!



 Stark? Stark!



 Look, he's convulsing. Give him air! Medic!

 MEDIC! You guys, some help!

 Stark, you--- your chest machine?



 Good job. Meet me in the alley. I'm gonna grab a quick slice.



 NO MORE STAIRS!!!!



 You'll be fine, Stark. Stay with us! I'll try something, okay? I have no idea if it's gonna work.



 YES!

 That worked a treat. That was so crazy!

 I had no idea if that was gonna work.

 The case?

 The case. It's, uhh... Where's the case? Where's Loki? Loki!

 That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?

 Oh, we blew it.

 Loki!



 Tony, what's going on? Tell me you found that cube.  Oh, you gotta be shitting me.



 I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.

  I am not Loki. And I don't wanna hurt you.



 I can do this all day.

  Yeah, I know. I know.



 Where did you get this?



 Bucky... is... alive!

 What?



 That is America's ass.



 Please, please!

 I'm sorry, I can't help you, Bruce. If I give up the Time Stone to help your Reality, I'm dooming my own.

 With all due respect, I'm not sure the science really supports that.



 The Infinity Stones create what you experience as the flow of time. Remove one stone and that flow splits.  Now, this may benefit your reality, but my new one…not so much. In this new branched Reality, without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness, our world will be overrun. Millions will suffer. So, tell me, Doctor, can your science prevent all that?

 No, but we can erase it. Because once we are done with the stones, we can return each one to its own timeline at the moment it was taken. So, chronologically, in that reality, it never left.



  But you are leaving out the most important part. In order to return the stones, you have to survive.

 We will. I will. I promise.

 I can't risk this Reality on a promise. It is the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone.

 Then, why the hell did Strange give it away?

  What did you say?

 Strange, he gave it away. He gave it to Thanos.

 Willingly?

 Yes.

 ...Why?

 I have no idea. Maybe he made a mistake.

 Or I did.  Strange is meant to be the best of us.

 So he must have done it for a reason.

 I fear you might be right. 

 Thank you.

 I'm counting on you, Bruce. We all are.



  Run diagnostics. Show me her memory file.

 Sire, the file appears entangled. It was a memory, but not hers. There's another consciousness sharing her network...another Nebula.

 Impossible.

 This duplicate carries a time stamp... from nine years in the future.

 Where is this other Nebula?

 In our solar system. On Morag.

 Can you access her?

 Yes. The two are linked.

 Search the duplicate's memories for Infinity Stones.



 And these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.

 Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in.

 Which means we have to pick our targets.

 Correct.



  Freeze image.

 Terrans.

 Avengers. Unruly wretches. What's that reflection? Amplify this, Maw.

  I don't understand. Two Nebulas.

 No. The same Nebula. From two different times. Set course for Morag. Scan the duplicate's memories. I want to see everything.



 My ladies, I'll see you after. Go on.



  What are you doing?

 Aah!!!

 Aah!!! You're better off leaving the sneaking to your brother.

 Yeah, I was simply just going for a walk, and uh... 

 What are you wearing?

 I always wear this. This is one of my favorites.

[Frigga puts her hand on Thor's face and takes a good look at him}

 What's wrong with your eye?

 Oh, my eye. That's... you remember the Battle of Haroquin? When I got hit in the face with a broadsword?

 You're not the Thor I know at all, are you?

  Yes, I am.

 The future hasn't been kind to you, has it?

 I didn't say I'm from the future.

 I was raised by witches, boy. I see with more than eyes, and you know that.



 I am totally, totally from the future.

 Yes, you are.

 I really need to talk to you.

 We can talk.







 His head was over there... His body over there... What was the point? I was too late. I was just standing there. Some idiot with an axe.

 You're no idiot. You're here aren't you? Seeking counsel from the wisest person in Asgard.

 I guess, yeah.

 Idiot? No. A failure? Absolutely.

 That's a little bit harsh.

 You do know what that makes you? Just like everyone else.

 I'm not supposed to be like everyone else, am I?

 Everyone fails at who they are supposed to be, Thor. The measure of a person, of a hero, is how well they succeed at being who they are.

 I really missed you, Mum.



 Thor! I got it!

 Get that rabbit!

 Ma, I have to tell you something.

 No, son. You don't. You're here to repair your future, not mine.

 But this is about your future.

 It's none of my business.

 Hey. You must be Mom. I got the thing. Come on, we got to move.

 I wish we had more time.

 No, this was a gift. And you're going to be the man you're meant to be.

 I love you, Mom.

 I love you. And eat a salad.

 Come on. We gotta go.

  Goodbye.

 Three... two...

 No, wait!



  Wh- what am I looking at?

 Oh, sometimes it takes a second.



  I'm still worthy.



 Oh, boy.

 Goodbye, Mom.

  Goodbye.



 So he's an idiot?

 Yeah.



 What's that?

 The tool of a thief.



 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...This is the part where spikes come out with skeletons on the end and everything...

 What are you talking about?

 When you break into a place called the temple of the Power Stone, There's gonna be a bunch of booby traps–



 Okay. All right. Go ahead.



 I wasn't always like this.

 Me either. But we work with what we got, right?



 Sync up.  Three.. two.. one...





 You murdered trillions!

 You should be grateful.

 Where are the stones?

 Gone. Reduced to atoms.

 You used them two days ago.

 I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be. I am inevitable.



 What did you do to them?

 Nothing. Yet. They're not trying to stop something I'm going to do in our time. They're trying to undo something I've already done in theirs.

 The stones...

 I found them all. I won. Tipped the cosmic scales to balance.



 This is your future.

 It's my destiny.



 My father is many things. A liar is not one of them.

 Thank you, Daughter. Perhaps I treated you too harshly...



 And that, is destiny fulfilled.

  Sire, your Daughter...



 No!

 ...is a traitor.

 That's not me. It's not. I could never...
I would never betray you. Never.



 I know. And you'll have the chance to prove it.



 No! He knows!  Barton? Barton, come in. Romanoff? Come in, we have a problem. Come on! Come in, we have a prob....Thanos knows. Thanos… He knows.



 Cap...



 Sorry, buddy. We got a problem.

 Huh. Yeah, we do.

 Well, what are we gonna do now?

 You know what? Give me a break, Steve. I just got hit in the head with a Hulk.

 You said that we had one shot. This, this was our shot. We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing. Six stones or nothing.

 You're repeating yourself, you know that? You're repeating yourself.

 You're repeating yourself. You're repeating yourself.

 No!

 No. No.

 Come on.

 You never wanted a time heist, you went on board with the time heist...

 I dropped the ball.

 You ruined the time heist.

 Is that what I did?

 Yeah!

 Are there any other options with the Tesseract?

 No, no, no. There's no other options. There's no do-overs. We're not going anywhere else. We have one particle left. Each. That's it, alright? We use that... Bye, bye. You're not going home.

 Yeah, well if we don't try, then no one else is going home, either.

 I got it. There's another way. To retake the Tesseract and acquire new particles. We'll stroll down memory lane. Military installation, Garden State.

 When were they both there?

 They were there at a...I've a vaguely exact idea.

 How vague?

 What are you talking about?Where are we going?

 I know for a fact they were there...

 Who's they? What are we doing?

 And I know how I know.

 Guys, what's up? What is it?

 Well, it looks like we're improvising.

 Right. What are we improvising?

 Scott, get this back to the compound.

 Suit up.

 What's in New Jersey?

 0-4, 0-4...
- Uhh, 0-7.

 0-7.
- Excuse me...

 
1-9-7-0.

 Are you sure?
- Cap. Captain. Steve, sorry, America. Rogers. Look,
if you do this, and this doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

 
Thanks for the pep talk, pissant. 
Do you trust me?

 
I do.

 
Your call.

 
Here we go.



  Hey, man! Make love, not war!

 Clearly, you weren't actually born here, right?

 The idea of me was.

 Right. Well, imagine
you're SHIELD, running a quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization. Where do you hide it?

 
In plain sight.



  Good luck on your
mission, Captain.

  
Good luck on your
project, doctor.

 
You're new here?

 Not exactly.



  
Gotcha. Back in the game.

 
Arnim, you in there? Arnim? Hey! Door's this way, pal.

 Oh, yeah.

 I'm looking for Dr. Zola.
Have you seen him?

 
Yeah, no, Dr. Zol... No,
I haven't seen a soul.

 Pardon me. Do I know you?

 No, sir. I'm, a... visitor from MIT.

 Huh. MIT. Got a name?

 Uh...Howard.

 Well, that'll be
easy to remember.

 Howard... Potts.

  
Well, I'm Howard Stark. 

 Hi.

 Shake it, don't pull it.

 Yeah...

 You look a little green around
the gills there, Potts.

 I'm fine. Just, long hours.

 Wanna get some air? Hello, Potts.

 Yeah. That would be swell.

 That way.

 Okay.

 Need your briefcase?

 You're not one of
those beatniks, are ya, Potts?



 Hello. Dr. Pym?

 That would be the number that you called. Yes.

 This is Captain Stevens from shipping. We have a package for you.

 Bring it up.

 Well, that's the thing, sir. We can't.

 I'm confused. I thought that was your job.

 Well, it's just... Sir,
the box is glowing and, to be honest, some of our mail
guys aren't feeling that great.

 They didn't open it, did they?

 Yeah, they did. You better get down here.



 Excuse me! Out of the way!



 So, flowers and sauerkraut. You
got a big date tonight?

 My wife's expecting. And, uh... Too much
time in the office.

 Congratulations.

 Thanks. Hold this, will you?

 Yeah, sure. How far along is she?

 I don't know... uh...She's at the point where she can't stand the sound of my chewing. I guess I'll be eating
dinner in the pantry again.

 I have a little girl.

 A girl would be nice. Less of a chance
she'd turn out exactly like me.

 What'd be so awful about that?

 Let's just say that the greater
good has rarely outweighed my own self-interests.



 And you've never seen these two men before?

 No, I've got an eye for this. The two of them looked fishy.

 Can you describe them?

 Well, one of them had a hippie beard.

 Hippie? Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

 Definitely Mungo Jerry.

 Yeah, this is Chesler. I
need every available MPs on sub-level 6. We have
a potential breach.



 So, where are you
at with names?

 Well, if it's a boy,
my wife likes Almanzo.

 Might wanna let that stew on.
You got time.

 Let me ask you a question. When your kid was born...were you nervous?

 Wildly. Yeah.

 Did you feel qualified? Like you had any idea how to
successfully operate that thing?

 I literally pieced it together as I went along, I thought about what my Dad did, and...

 My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt.

 I thought my dad was tough on me. And now, looking back, I just remember the good stuff, you know. He did drop the odd pearl.

 Yeah? Like what?

 "No amount of money ever
bought a second of time."

 Smart guy.

 He did his best.


Let me tell you. That
kid's not even here yet, and there's nothing I
wouldn't do for him. Good to meet you, Potts.

 Yeah, Howard...Everything's gonna be all right. Thank you for everything you've done for this country.

 Jarvis, have we ever met that guy?

 You meet a lot of people, sir.

 Seems very familiar. Weird beard.



 You're weak.

 I'm you.



 You can stop this. You know you want to. Did you see what
happens in the future? Thanos finds the Soul Stone. You wanna know
how he does that? You wanna know what
he does to you?

 That's enough. You disgust me. But that doesn't
mean you're useless.



 How do I look?

.

 Wow... Under different circumstances, this would be totally awesome.



 
I bet the raccoon didn't
have to climb a mountain.

 
Technically, he's not
a raccoon, you know.

 
Whatever. He eats garbage

 Welcome.



 
Natasha, daughter of Ivan. Clint, son of Edith.

 Who are you?

 Consider me a guide. To you, and to all who
seek the Soul Stone.

 Oh, good. You tell us where it is.
Then we'll be on our way.

 Ah, liebchen... If only it were that easy.



 What you seek lies
in front of you... as does what you fear.

 The stone is down there.

 For one of you. For the other... In order to take the stone, you
must lose that which you love. An everlasting exchange. A soul, for a soul.



 How's it going? Jesus...Maybe he's making this shit up.

 No. I don't think so.

 Why, 'cause he knows your Daddy's name?

 I didn't. Thanos left here with the stone without his daughter. It's not a coincidence.

 Yeah.

 Whatever it takes.

 Whatever it takes.



 If we don't get that stone, billions of people stay dead.

 Then I guess we both know who it's gotta be.

 
I guess we do.



 
I'm starting to think, we've been
different people here, Natasha.

 For the last five years I've been trying
 Get to right here. That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

 Oh, don't you get all decent on me now.

 What, you think I wanna do it? I'm trying to save
your life, you idiot.

 
Yeah well, I don't want
you to, because I...Natasha, you know
what I've done. You know what I've become.

 I don't judge people on
their worst mistakes.

 
Maybe you should.

 
You didn't.

 
You're a pain in my
ass, you know that?



 Okay. You win.



 
Tell my family I love them.



  
You tell them yourself.



 
Damn you!

 
Let me go.

 
No. 
Please, no

 
It's okay.

 
Please... No!





 
Did we get them all?

 You telling me this'll
actually work?



 
Clint, where's Nat?





 Do we know if she had family?

 Yeah. Us.

  What?

 I just asked him a question...

 Yeah, you're acting like she's dead. Why are we acting like she's dead? We have the stones, right? As long as we have the stones, Cap, we can bring her back, isn't that right?  So stop this shit. We're the Avengers, get it together.

 We can't get her back.

 Wha- what?

 It can't be undone. It can't.



 I'm sorry. No offense, but you're
a very earthly being. Okay? We're talking about space magic. And "can't" seems very definitive don't you think?

  Look, I know that I'm way outside my paygrade here. But she still isn't here, is she?

 Now that's my point...

 It can't... be undone. Or that's at least what the, great floating guy had to say.  Maybe you wanna go talk to him? Okay? Go grab your hammer, and you go fly and you talk to him!



 It was supposed to be me. She sacrificed her life for that
goddamned stone. She bet her life on it.



 She's not coming back. We have to make it worth it. We have to.

 We will.



 Boom!



 All right. The glove's ready. Question is, who's gonna snap their freaking fingers?

 I'll do it.

 Excuse me?

 It's okay.

  No, no, no, whoa. Stop. Stop. Wait a sec. Hey, hey...

 Wait, wait, wait, Thor, just wait. We haven't decided who's
gonna put that on yet.


I'm sorry. What, we're just sitting
around waiting for the right opportunity?

 We should at least discuss it.

 No, no, sitting here staring at that
thing is not gonna bring everybody back. I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So this responsibility falls upon me. It's my duty.

 It's not that...

  It's... stop it! Just let me.  Just let me do it. Just let me do something good. Something great.

 Look...It's not just the fact that that glove is channeling enough energy to light up a continent, I'm telling you, you're in no condition.

 What do you think is coursing
through my veins right now?

 Cheez Whiz?

 Lightning.

 Yeah.

 Lightning won't help you, pal. It's gotta be me.



 You saw what those stones did to Thanos. It almost killed him. None of you could survive.

 How do we know you will?

 We don't. But the radiation's mostly gamma.  It's like...uh...I was made for this.



 Good to go, yeah?

 Let's do it.

 You remember... everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago and just bringing them back to now, today. Don't change anything from the last five years.

 Got it.



 F.R.I.D.A.Y., do me a favor and activate Barn Door Protocol. Will you?

 Yes, boss.



 Everybody comes home.



 Take it off! Take it off!

 No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?

 Talk to me, Banner.

 I'm okay. I'm okay.





 Bruce!

 Don't move him.

  Did it work?

 Worth a shot. It's over. It's okay.



  Honey. Honey.

 Guys... I think it worked!





 I can't breathe. I can't breathe! I can't breathe.

 Canopy. Canopy. Canopy. 

 Rhodey, Rocket, get outta here!



 Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on!



 Rhodey!





 Mayday, mayday! Does anybody copy? We're in the lower level, it's flooding!

 What?

 We're drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday!

 Wait! I'm here! I'm here, can you hear me?



 Cap?



  Damn.





 Daughter.

 Yes, Father. So, this is the future. Well done.



 Thank you, Father. They suspected nothing.



 The arrogant never do.



 Go. Find the stones. Bring them to me.

 What will you do?

 Wait.



 Tell me something. In the future, what happens to you and me?

 I tried to kill you. Several times.



 But eventually,
we become friends. We become sisters.



 
Come on. We can stop him.





 Come on, buddy. Wake up. That's my man. You lose this again, I'm keeping it.

 What happened?

 We messed with time.
It tends to mess back. You'll see.



 What's he been doing?

 Absolutely nothing.

 Where are the stones?

 Somewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn't have them.

 So we keep it that way.

 You know it's a trap, right?

 Yeah. And I don't much care.

 Good. Just as long we are all in agreement.  Let's kill him properly this time.



 You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Back to me. I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you’ve shown me that’s impossible. And as long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist.

 Yep. We're all kinds of stubborn.

 I'm thankful. Because now, I know
what I must do.  I will shred this universe
down to its last atom.  And then...With the stones you've collected
for me, create a new one. Teeming with life, but knows not what it has lost
but only what it has been given.  A grateful universe.

 Born out of blood.

 They'll never know it. Because you won't be
alive to tell them.



 See you on the other side, man.

 Hang on! I'm coming!



 Oh, hey...I know you.

 Father. I have the stones.

 What?!



 Stop.

 You're betraying us?

 You don't have to do this.

 I am... this.

 No, you're not.

 You've seen what we become.

 Nebula, listen to her.

 You can change.

 He won't let me.



 No!



 Okay, Thor. Hit me.



 Boss, wake up.



 I knew it!









 In all my years of conquest...violence...slaughter... It was never personal. But I'll tell you now... what I'm about to do to your stubborn, annoying little planet... I'm gonna enjoy it. Very, very much.



 Hey, Cap, you read me?



 Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me?



 On your left.



 Is that everyone?

 What, you wanted more?



 AVENGERS! ...assemble.





 No, no, give me that. You have the little one.



 Hey! Holy cow! You will not believe what's been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? I must've passed out, Because I woke up, and you were gone. But Doctor Strange was there, right? He was like, "It's been five years. Come on, they need us." And then he started doing the yellow
sparkly thing that he does all the time. What are you doing?



 Oh, this is nice.



 Gamora?  I thought I lost you.



 Ow.

  Don't.. touch...  me!



 You missed the first time... Then you got them both the second time.

  This is the one? Seriously?

 The choices were him, or a tree.





 Cap, what do you want me to do with this damn thing?

 Get those stones as far away as possible!

 No! We need to get them back where they came from.

 No way to get them back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.

 Hold on!  That wasn't our only time machine.



 Anyone see an ugly, brown van up there?

 Yes! But you're not gonna like where it's parked.

 Scott, how long you need to get that thing working?

 Maybe ten minutes.

 Get it started. We'll get the stones to you.

 We're on it, Cap.



 Hey. You said one out of 14
million, we win, yeah? Tell me this is it.

 If I tell you what happens, it won't happen.

 You better be right.



 It's a mess back here.

 It's... it's dead.

 What?

 It's dead. I have to hotwire it.

 Where's Nebula?

 She's not responding.

  Sire!



 Clint! Give it to me.



 You took everything from me.

 I don't even know who you are.

 You will.



 I got it! Activate Instant Kill!

 Rain fire!

 But Sire, our troops!

 Just do it!

 Uh, is anyone else seeing this?

 I got this. I got this! Okay, I don't got this. Help! Somebody, help!

 Hey, Queens. Heads up.



 Hang on. I got you, kid. 

 Hey! Nice to meet you--- Oh, my God!



 What the hell is this?

 F.R.I.D.A.Y., what are they firing at?

 Something just entered the upper atmosphere.



 Oh, yeah!

 Danvers, we need an assist here.



 Hi. I'm Peter Parker.

 Hey, Peter Parker. You got something for me?

  I don't know how you're gonna get it through all that.



 Don't worry.

 She's got help.



 I am... inevitable.



 And I... am... Iron Man.





 Mr. Stark?  Hey... Mr. Stark? Can you hear me? It's Peter. Hey. We won, Mr. Stark... We won, Mr. Stark. We won. You did it, sir. You did it.



 I'm sorry... Tony...



 Hey.



  Hey, Pep...



 F.R.I.D.A.Y.?

 Life functions critical.



 Tony. Look at me.  We're gonna be okay. You can rest now.





 Everybody wants a happy ending, right? But it doesn't always roll that way. Maybe this time. I'm hoping if you play this back, it's in celebration. I hope families are reunited, I hope we get it back, and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored. If there ever was such a thing. God, what a world. Universe, now. If you told me ten years ago that we weren't alone, let alone, you know, to this extent, I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised. But come on, you know? The epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play. And, for better or worse, that's the reality Morgan's gonna have to find a way to grow up in.



 So I thought I'd probably better record a little greeting... In the case of an untimely death on my part. I mean, not that, death at any time isn't untimely. This time travel thing that we're gonna try and pull off tomorrow, it's... it's got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all. That's the thing. Then again, that's the hero gig. Part of the journey is the end.  What am I even trippin' for? Everything's gonna work out exactly the way it's supposed to.  I love you 3,000.







 You know, I wish there was a way...that I could let her know. That we won.  We did it.

 She knows...They both do.





 How you doing, Squirt?

 Good.

 You good? Okay. You hungry?

 Mm-hmm.

 What do you want?

 Cheeseburgers.

 You know your dad liked cheeseburgers? I'm gonna get you all the cheeseburgers you want.

 Okay.



 So, when can we expect you back?

 Um... about that...

 Thor. Your people need a king.

 No, they already have one.

 That's funny. You're being serious?



 It's time for me to be who I am rather than who I'm supposed to be. But you, you're a leader. That's who you are.

 You know I'd make a lot of changes around here.

 I'm counting on it. Your Majesty.



 What will you do?

 I'm not sure. For the first time in a thousand years, I... I have no path. I do have a ride, though.



 Move it or lose it, hairbag.



 Well, here we are. Tree! Good to see you. Well...  The Asgardians of the Galaxy, back together again.



 Where to first?

 Hey, just so you know, this is my ship still. I'm in charge.

 I know. I know. Of course, you are. Of course.

 See, you say of course, but then you touch the map. It makes you think that maybe you didn't realize I was in charge.

 Quail... you... that-that's your own–

 Quail?

 ...insecurities in there. Okay? I'm merely trying to be of service and assisting.

 Quill.

 That's what I said.

 You should fight one another for the honor of leadership.

 Sounds fair.



 It's not necessary.

 It's not.

 Okay?

 I got some blasters, unless you guys wanna use knives.

  Oh, yes. Please, use knives.

 Yeah, knives.

 I am Groot.



 Not necessary.

 Not nece-there shall be no knifing one another. Everybody knows who's in charge.

  Me, right?

 Yes, you. Of course. Of course. Of course.



 Now, remember... You have to return the stones to the exact moment you got them. Or you're gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities.

 Don't worry, Bruce. Clip all the branches.

 You know, I tried. When I had the gauntlet, the stones, I really tried to bring her back.  I miss them, man.

 Me, too.

 You know, if you want, I can come with you.

 You're a good man, Sam. This one's on me, though.



 Don't do anything stupid 'till I get back.

 How can I? You're taking all the stupid with you.



 Gonna miss you, Buddy.

 It's gonna be okay, Buck.



 How long is this gonna take?

 For him? As long as he needs. For us? Five seconds.



 Ready, Cap? Alright. We'll meet
you back here, okay?

 You bet.

 Going quantum. Three, two, one...



 And returning in, five, four, three, two, one...



 Where is he?

 I don't know. He blew right by his time stamp. He should be here.



 Well, get him back.

 I'm trying.

 Get him the hell back!

 Hey, I said, I'm trying!

 Sam.



 Go ahead.



 Cap?

 Hi, Sam.



 So did something go wrong, or did something go right?

 Well, after I put the stones back, I thought, maybe I'll try some of that life Tony was telling me to get.

 How did that work out for you?

 It was beautiful.

 I'm happy for you. Truly.

 Thank you.

 Only thing bumming me out is the fact I have to live in a world without Captain America.

 Oh, That reminds me.  Try it on.



 How's it feel?

 Like it's someone else's.

 It isn't.



 Thank you. I'll do my best.

 That's why it's yours. 

  You wanna tell me about her?

  No. No, I don't think I will.
